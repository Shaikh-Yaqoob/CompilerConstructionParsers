# **CompilerConstructionParsers**

Welcome to the **CompilerConstructionParsers** repository! This collection includes projects developed for my **Compiler Construction** course, focusing on implementing parsers using various parsing techniques and algorithms essential for building compilers.

## **Key Features**

- **Lexical Analysis**: Implementation of tokenization techniques to break down source code into meaningful components.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Building and evaluating parsers using grammar rules.
- **Parsing Techniques**:
  - **LL(1) Parser**
  - **LR(0) Parser**
  - **SLR(1) Parser**

## **What's Included?**

- Code for implementing **LL(1)**, **LR(0)**, and **SLR(1)** parsers.
- Examples demonstrating how to use each parser effectively.

## **Projects Included**

### **LL(1) Parser**:
- Grammar-based top-down parsing implementation.
- Handles predictive parsing efficiently.

### **LR(0) Parser**:
- Demonstrates bottom-up parsing techniques.
- Includes state-machine-driven parsing logic.

### **SLR(1) Parser**:
- Implements a more refined version of LR parsing with lookahead sets.
- Ensures grammar consistency.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaikh-Yaqoob/CompilerConstructionParsers.git
