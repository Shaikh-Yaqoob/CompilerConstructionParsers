# CompilerConstructionParsers
Welcome to the CompilerConstructionParsers repository! This repository is a collection of projects that I developed as part of my Compiler Construction subject. It focuses on implementing parsers using various parsing techniques and algorithms essential for building compilers.

Key Features

Lexical Analysis: Implementation of tokenization techniques to break down source code into meaningful components.

Syntax Analysis: Building and evaluating parsers using grammar rules.

Parsing Techniques:

LL(1) Parser

LR(0) Parser

SLR(1) Parser

Error Detection and Recovery: Mechanisms for identifying and handling syntax errors.

What's Included?

Code for implementing LL(1), LR(0), and SLR(1) parsers.

Examples demonstrating how to use each parser effectively.

Error handling and recovery mechanisms in parsing.

Projects Included

LL(1) Parser:

Grammar-based top-down parsing implementation.

Handles predictive parsing efficiently.

LR(0) Parser:

Demonstrates bottom-up parsing techniques.

Includes state-machine-driven parsing logic.

SLR(1) Parser:

Implements a more refined version of LR parsing with lookahead sets.

Ensures grammar consistency.

Error Handling Demonstrations:

Projects showing syntax error detection and recovery strategies.

How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Shaikh-Yaqoob/CompilerConstructionParsers.git

Navigate to the desired parser directory.

Follow the instructions in the respective README file or documentation to run the project.

Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional parsing techniques to share, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
